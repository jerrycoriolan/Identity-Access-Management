Practical Assessment: Identity & Access Management 

I will assess an application and advise Goodcorp on securing its most sensitive asset from an identity and access management perspective. 

I find that any employee member of the research lab has read access to the formula. I also found that someone has full admin access to the database. Employees can log in to the database using a username and a password. There is also a lot of documentation related to a sensitive medication formula stored in a Microsoft SQL Database Server 2022.

The following IAM recommendations will uplift the security of the data:

Multi-Factor Authentication
-	Key Initiative: An enterprise-wide two-factor authentication system will be rolled out for all employees to access Goodcorp’s environment. 

-	An additional multi-factor authentication will be required to access the database. This could be a biometric solution such as fingerprints. 

-	An approval process should occur whenever someone wants to access the system. 

Principle of Least Privilege
-	Restrict access to the formula only to those who need it for their job function. Not all members of the research lab should have access. 

-	Implement Role-Based access control (RBAC). Access to the formula should be assigned to a ‘role.’ Individuals who need access to the formula should be assigned the role temporarily for the duration of their need. Access should be revoked after the task is complete. 

Separation of Duties
-	No person should have too much power, so separate full access by two accounts. 

User Access Reviews
-	Regular access reviews for this critical application.
